Thank you for downloading the official FreeSO Launcher!

This program is designed to make it easier to install and play FreeSO, the free and open source reimplementation of The Sims Online. It is not affiliated with EA or Maxis in any way.

By installing this software, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

- The program does not contain a copy of The Sims Online or any other content related to EA IP. Necessary files are downloaded from Archive.org through the Installer tab, as requested by the user.
- FreeSO is obtained from the official FreeSO GitHub releases.
- OpenAL and .NET Framework are bundled within the launcher's source files, eliminating the need for an active internet connection during installation.
- Remeshes are stored compressed on a remote server and can be downloaded at the user's discretion.
- To check for updates and improve troubleshooting, the program occasionally sends requests to a remote server, which include details such as your launcher version and FreeSO installation status (yes/no).
- The launcher connects to a remote server via a socket to receive live updates and news from FreeSO Administrators in the form of desktop notifications. No other remote tasks are performed by the launcher aside from receiving notifications.
