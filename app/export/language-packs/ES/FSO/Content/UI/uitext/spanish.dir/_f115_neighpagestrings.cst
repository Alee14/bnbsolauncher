49 ^Are you sure you want to place the town hall here? The land costs are paid for by M.O.M.I, but you will have to pay a flat $2000 processing fee.^
50 ^You cannot place a Town Hall in any neighborhood it is not meant for. Your Town Hall must be placed in %s.^
51 ^As tempting as it may be, you cannot force people out of their homes in order to place the Town Hall here. We'll pretend you didn't try to do that, and let you choose another location.^

52 ^You have placed the Town Hall for %s. As Mayor, you can freely change its name and description from its Property Page. Since it is a community lot, anyone allowed by your admission settings will also be able to open the property.^

55 ^You have already rated this Mayor. Rating them again will replace your old comment and rating - are you sure you want to continue?^

90 ^You need at least $2000 to place or move a Town Hall property, to cover processing fees.^
91 ^You are now placing the Town Hall for %s. This will replace all controls for moving your own property in the city view - you'll remain in this mode as long as you see the indicator in the title bar. Purchasing a lot in this mode costs a flat $2000, regardless of location! If you change your mind, click Cancel to back out.

You can only place a Town Hall within the neighborhood you are Mayor of, and you cannot place it on any land that is already occupied (obviously). The location of the Town Hall can be changed later for the same price of $2000, if a better location opens up or you want a change of scenery.^
